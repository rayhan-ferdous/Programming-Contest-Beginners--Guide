then follow this guide (according to the serial number of the contents) and it will familiarize you with the contest fashion and all necessary gear ups. later you can continue to improve yourself with practice and learning year after year.

N.B. if you know basic programming you can start from the content labeled with 1. content labeled with 0 is a Bangla book on programming. You can read any other nice book to learn basic programming if you prefer other language.

this guide was created while I was around at my final year of undergraduate studies and used to take part in contests very often. have taught my younger brother basic programming already then. suddenly the govt. of Bangladesh started to organize high school level contests and he wanted to go, without a single contest experience. So I created this guide for him. surprising me- he solved 3 problems in his first participation and was within top 20. later on, he is still continuing to take part in contests and always standing within top 3 now a days. his online contest ranking is also uprising. although, rank and position is not the main achievement in contest, but I believe this guide had the nice start direction for him. that's why I decided to share it with other youngstars that might be good for them too!

He is now an IOI 2019 bronze medalist!
